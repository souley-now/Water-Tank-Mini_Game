Water Tank is a competitive card game played between two players. In your case, the players will be a human player and a computer player. Each player starts with an empty water tank, which they need to fill. The goal is to be the first player to fill their tank. A tank is filled if it reaches the value of 75 to 80 units (inclusive). There are two types of cards: water cards and power cards. There will be a pile for each type of card (one pile for water and one pile for power). Each water card has a value that represents the amount of water that it contributes to the tank. When a water card is played, that player
adds the specified amount of water to their tank. Power cards allow players to perform special
actions:
● SOH (Steal Opponent’s Half): Take half the water in your opponent’s tank and add it to
your own
● DOT (Drain Opponent’s Tank): Empty your opponent’s tank completely
● DMT (Double My Tank): Double the current value of your own tank   

If a player’s water level exceeds their tank’s maximum fill value, an overflow happens. In the case of an overflow, extra water sloshes out of the tank. The amount of water that remains in the tank is determined by a formula: remaining water = maximum fill value - overflow
